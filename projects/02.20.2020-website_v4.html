                <div class="body"><p>In the span of three days, I wrote and actually finished the fourth iteration of my website, aptly titledâ€¦ <code>website v4</code>. Even though this is <em>literally the first finished iteration of it</em>. Ignore the previous iterations from the past two years (and the fact that I lost an iteration due to a hard drive formatting).</p>
<p>So, into the technical stuff. What does this do, how does it work, and any other things.</p>
<p><em>Just a fair warning: I am not very qualified to write about this stuff. And also this is very substanceless. Cool.</em></p>
<h1 id="thegoalofitall">The Goal Of It All</h1>
<p>I wrote <code>website v4</code> with one main goal: to be able to write my posts and projects in Markdown (with YAML front matter serving as metadata). This was an ambitious goal, mainly because of the fact that I have nearly zero experience with JavaScript (what the "compiler" was written in) - or any other programming language, for that matter. The fact that this is still working is amazing.</p>
<h1 id="howitallworks">How It All Works</h1>
<p>The compiler is written in JavaScript with Node.js, and utilizes two main libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter">gray-matter</a> <a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter">(repo)</a> - used for parsing the YAML into some usable information</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown">showdown</a> <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">(repo)</a> - actually turning the markdown into an html site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how does it all work? (Or at least, how is it supposed to?)</p>
<p>First, the script (<code>main.js</code>) is executed. It proceeds to read the contents of two preset directories, <code>/blog/md</code>, and <code>/projects/md</code>, where the markdown files are stored. After that, for each file in the directory, it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reads the file, and saves the content into a variable.</li>
<li>Uses <code>gray-matter</code> to parse the file, and save the result of that into a variable.</li>
<li>Uses <code>showdown</code> to convert the markdown into HTML</li>
<li>Appends some extra HTML to the result. This is where the YAML comes in handy - it plugs in variables in certain spots, such as the title, the date, progress (if the file is a project), etc.</li>
<li>Saves the file to the parent directory (of the <code>/md</code> directory). </li>
<li>Somewhere along the line, it would update <code>index.html</code> with a little entry so people can actually access it.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's how it should work. It's actually a lot messier than that. (Don't read the source code, it's a nightmare.)</p>
<p>And that's all! I hope. I'm not coming back to this. Ever.</p>
<p>Until the inevitable re:re:rewrite,</p>
