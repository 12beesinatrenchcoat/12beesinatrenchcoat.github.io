                <div class="body"><p><strong>Pencil to Pluto</strong> is an incremental game developed by me, with some music by my friend, <strong>AlexTheYes</strong>. </p>
<p>It was created in the <a href="godotengine.org">Godot Engine</a> for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2020">Summer 2020 My First Game Jam</a> - and as nearly all things on my website (well, all things, currently), the source code is public, and can be found <a href="https://github.com/AndyThePie/pencil-to-pluto">here</a>.
(Not that the source code for everything I've ever made is public and can be found at that exact repository, but… you know what I mean.)</p>
<p>While the game jam lasted 14 days, the submission was produced in 7 - and the result was sub-par…</p>
<p>My thoughts on the game post-jam can be found in <a href="../blog/2020.07.26-pencil_to_pluto_postmortem.html">the postmortem</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to write more information here as the game continues development.</p>
