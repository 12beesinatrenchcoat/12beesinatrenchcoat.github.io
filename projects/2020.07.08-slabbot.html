The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/AndyThePie/slabbot">here</a>, I suppose. You can't invite the bot to a server yet because I still don't have any method to host it. Yet.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Slabbot</em> was originally going to be a fork and overhaul of <em><a href="https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon">despacitoBot;</a></em> with more features and cool stuff, but I didn't feel like looking at my old code, so I decided to just rewrite it from scratch.</li>
<li>Like <em>despacitoBot</em>, <em>Slabbot</em> is also written in JavaScript, utilizing Node.js and Discord.js. However, this time, I employed the help of the <a href="https://discord-akairo.github.io">Akairo Framework</a>! Not that I'm really putting it to any good use, but…</li>
<li><em>Slabbot</em> is a portmanteau of the words "slab" and "bot" - like a slab, the bot is large, thick, flat, and typically made of stone- wait, no, hold on-</li>
<li><em>Slabbot</em> is pronounced like "rabbit", so… <em>"slæbət"</em>? Don't ask.</li>
<li>I still don't understand ES6. </li>
