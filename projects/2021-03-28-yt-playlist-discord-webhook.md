I and some friends have this *collaborative playlist* — a playlist on YouTube that we all have permission to add videos to. I thought it would be fun to have a message sent in a Discord channel every time someone did that. 

I first looked to IFTTT, then Zapier, and somehow disastisfied with both (I don't remember why) and wanting an excuse to dabble in Python, this was created.

It… works. I guess.
