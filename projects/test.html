<p>Well, fourth time's the charm, I suppose!</p>
<h1>20 february 2020</h1>
<p>Wow, what a date, huh? I'm actually starting to write posts and all the sort. that's pretty cool. I'm also going to start writing these progress logs.</p>
<p>But before that, let's talk about the things before today, when I started this project.</p>
<h2>before today</h2>
<p>Why did i scrap and rebuild my website again? Because i didn't like it. I was bad at the code, the code was also messy and all the sort, and so I just wanted to start over - simpler, this time. Something not overly complex. Except I <em>am</em> very much overcomplicating this.</p>
<h2>plans for all of this mess</h2>
<p>I want a website with a blog and a project list. I want it to automatically update for each post. I also want to be able to write all of my posts in markdown because I absolutely hate messing with HTML, despite the fact that what I'm going to do now is a horrible idea.</p>
<p>I also want to try messing around with sass.</p>
<p>So... how will i do this?</p>
<h3>sass</h3>
<p>I want to figure out how to use sass, and so I'm just going to rewrite the stylesheet in sass. why? it just sounds fun.</p>
<h3>the posts</h3>
<p>This one's going to be a nightmare. I'm going to be writing a script (probably in C#) that will turn the Markdown files into actual HTML files in <code>/blog</code> and in <code>/projects</code>. This (should) also add an item under the respective tab in <code>index.html</code>. I'm hoping this doesn't end horribly. I'm crossing my fingers.</p>
<h2>update 01</h2>
<p>sass isn't too bad. i like it.</p>
<h2>update 02</h2>
<p>I've chosen a  library: Markdig. It has little documentation, though. With my very limited knowledge on C#, I'll do my best!</p>
<h2>update 03 (7:38PM)</h2>
<p>this was a mistake</p>
<h1>21 february 2020</h1>
<p>We're back. I'm more sane now, it's the morning, let's try and get something done. I have the following goals to accomplish the build system, and in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a file written with proper stylesheets and all the sort.</li>
<li>Get the YAML to represent metadata and all the sort - make it the page header, etc.</li>
<li>Make a little navigation bar on the right and maybe a progress bar or something to style things up.</li>
<li>Get an element written to the <code>index.html</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So... let's hope. I'll write something more whenever I actually get something done. This isn't a diary.</p>
<h2>progress update 1 (10:39AM)</h2>
<p>I have... this. It looks bad. But we're getting somewhere.</p>

<p>Using Markdig, I'm getting a specific file, and writing all of it's contents into a string using <code>System.IO.File.ReadAllText</code>, before converting it into HTML with <code>Markdown.ToHtml</code>. I prepend some HTML that links on a stylesheet, and now we have this. It's a good start. I thing.</p>
