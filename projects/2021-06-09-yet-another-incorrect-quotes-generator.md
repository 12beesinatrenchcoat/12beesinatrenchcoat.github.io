> **12beesinatrenchcoat**{.semibold}: i'm kinda tempted to make my own incorrect quotes generator
> **12beesinatrenchcoat**{.semibold}: it'd be a fun project

The day after *HATSUNE MIKU EXPO 2021 Online*, a friend and I were messing around with ScatterPatter's Incorrect Quotes Generator, putting in the names of the Cryptonloids, later Project Sekai characters, and laughing at the results. I then, for some reason, decided that it would be a fun idea to try to make my own clone, including pronouns, and other features.

This project taught me about how planning is necessary, and how development takes much longer if you just add more and more features without knowing what you're doing.  
And I mean a *lot* longer. This took months.

This was my first time writing JavaScript in a browser. I think it went alright.
