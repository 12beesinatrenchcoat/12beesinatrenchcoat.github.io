**Pencil to Pluto** is an incremental game developed by me, with some music by my friend, **AlexTheYes**. 

It was created in the [Godot Engine](godotengine.org) for the [Summer 2020 My First Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2020) - and as nearly all things on my website (well, all things, currently), the source code is public, and can be found [here](https://github.com/AndyThePie/pencil-to-pluto).
(Not that the source code for everything I've ever made is public and can be found at that exact repository, but... you know what I mean.)

While the game jam lasted 14 days, the submission was produced in 7 - and the result was sub-par...

My thoughts on the game post-jam can be found in [the postmortem](../blog/2020.07.26-pencil_to_pluto_postmortem.html).



I hope to write more information here as the game continues development.
