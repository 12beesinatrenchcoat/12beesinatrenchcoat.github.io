# this is a readme

The name of a file in this folder should match: `YYYY-MM-DD-projectname.md` (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is when the project started.) See [Posts (in Jekyll Docs)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

The YAML front matter for the files should be something like:

```yaml
title: # the title
description: # description
tags:	
  # a list of tags.
startDate: # the date the project started, in format YYYY-MM-DD
endDate: # used only for projects where status is "complete" or "scrapped"
status: # status can be: "complete", "wip", "on_hold", or "scrapped"
headerImage: # header image. please refer to image relative to site root.
```
