# this is where projects go!

in case you forgot the formatâ€¦

file names go like:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
```

and front matter is like:
```yaml

description: "give a short description of the project."
image: "a url to the banner image of the project!"
type: "type of project, i guess"
tags: # should be a list.
  - js
endDate: 2020-02-23 # when the project ended. do not include if the project is ongoing.
status: "complete" # status can be: "complete", "wip", "on_hold", or "scrapped"
```
