				<p>whoops.<br>
my hand slipped.</p>
<p>In the project page for <a href="/posts/2020-02-20-website_v4.md">website v4</a>, I jokingly said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until the inevitable re:re:rewrite,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And offline, I'd throw around jokes about how I'd end up hating my website so much that I would never update it - that the rewrite of the website was inevitable. Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Past me was correct.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/old_website-v4.webp" alt="A screenshot of my old website."></p>
<p>The old website was... not great. At least, by my [current] standards (which, admittedly, are still very, <em>very</em> low). The code used to make it was a mess - if I were to change the site's look in a few years time, I'd have to rewrite the thing, sorting through lines and lines of unformatted HTML in an already confusing, spaghetti JavaScript file. Oh, and it doesn't look... great.</p>
<p>However, you learn these things with retrospect - when you do something, you learn from it. You figure out what worked, what didn't, even if you can't put it into words (please <em>don't</em> see the <a href="posts/2020-07-26-pencil_to_pluto_postmortem.md">Pencil to Pluto Postmortem</a>). I learned from website v4 that <s>am an awful programmer</s> I overestimated my knowledge of JavaScript, and also that I <em>really</em> should have just used a static site generator such as Jekyll instead of trying to create my own, featureless version of it.</p>
<p>So I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to rewrite my website, with a new framework, a new design, all of that. Make it so that I'd actually want to come back and write something every now and then. I think I accomplished that. I hope.</p>
<h2 id="alright%2C-alright%2C-so-what's-new%3F" tabindex="-1">Alright, alright, so what's new?</h2>
<p>Well, I added some things, I removed some things, but fundamentally, the site works the same way it used to. Takes <code>.md</code> files in folders, turns them into <code>.html</code> files, adds some nice styles, headers, etc. One thing of note that I've removed: progress bars. I don't like them, nor do I like constantly updating people on my work - I just like doing this stuff without worrying.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/website_v4_vs_v5.webp" alt="A comparison of website v4 and v5."></p>
<p>I've switched to using Jekyll - no more of that clunky handwritten site generator. It's honestly quite nice, I can just simply <s>struggle with</s> write some HTML, plug in some fields, and I have a properly functioning site. That being said, this did take a bit longer than website v4, taking a bit under two weeks instead of three days. This website is still hosted via GitHub Pages, and still with a clunky build script running after each push (see <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/">Jekyll Docs</a> on building with GitHub Actions).</p>
<p>Oh, and the patterns for each project. I really like them. They were a horrific mess to set up, but they're simple enough - a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the <code>background-image</code> set to the project's respective header image, followed by an absolutely positioned <code>::before</code> pseudo-element layering some patterns I stole from the <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/">CSS3 Patterns Gallery</a>, and a slight dim, created by a <code>linear-gradient</code> that goes from a translucent black to... the same translucent black. (Status is also displayed with an <code>::after</code> pseudo-element, in the bottom-right.)</p>
<p>Even while writing this, I'm still changing some minor things in the site, adding a little translucent white background to each post on the blog listing, and before I publish all of this, I plan on converting as many images as I can to the <code>.webp</code> format, hopefully lowering the likely massive load and size of this site - sorry about that!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll stop now. You're looking at website v5 - and I hope it doesn't look... awful.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading, something something something.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's an <a href="/feed.xml">RSS feed now</a>.</p>
