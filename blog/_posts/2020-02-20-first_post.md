hello there! if you're currently reading this, that means that everything is (probably) working. or not. we'll see.

# this is a big header.

this page is basically here to test to see if the scripts and all the sort work. we'll see.

## this is a smaller header.

```js
this.is("some improper");
code();
that.probably("doesn't" + make);

[ edit from the future (22 dec 2020): the old website didn't have any code formatting. it was just set in a monospace font with a darker grey background. fantastic, i know. ]

these markdown files are being written in [Typora](https://typora.io), a very good markdown editor that i would recommend because it is very good.
