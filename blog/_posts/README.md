# this is a readme

The name of a file in this folder should match: `YYYY-MM-DD-projectname.md` (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the post.) See [Posts (in Jekyll Docs)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

The YAML front matter for the files should be something like:

```yaml
title: # the title
description: # description
headerImage: # header image. please refer to image relative to site root.
```

Similar to the projects, huh?
