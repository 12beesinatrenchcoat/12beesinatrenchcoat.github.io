# this is where blog posts go!

in case you forgot the formatâ€¦

file names go like:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
```

and front matter is like:
```yaml
title: "the title of the post, project, or what not"
description: "give a short description of the post."
image: "a url to the banner image of the post!"
```
