			<strong>A note: this is very outdated!</strong> “Website v4” has been gone
			for a while now. If you want to see what it was like, you can find a
			release
			<a
				href="https://github.com/AndyThePie/AndyThePie.github.io/releases/tag/v4"
				>here</a
			>. If you want to see my [initial] thoughts on the current website, please
			see my post on
			<a href="/projects/2020-12-15-website_v5.html">website v5</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Welcome to the fourth iteration of my website, website v4! There’s a bunch
			of new things here, a
			<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/projects/</code>
			section, a
			<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog/</code> section,
			with posts now written in Markdown, and compiled using
			<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gray-matter</code> and
			<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showdown</code>. I’m
			surprised it’s actually working.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can probably find the project page, where I’ll go more in detail about
			the behind the scenes of it all
			<a href="/projects/2020-02-20-website_v4">around here somewhere</a>. Here,
			I’ll talk about why I rewrote my site, and some things I learned. Please
			note that I am a relatively new “developer” with an extraordinary lack of
			experience. Cool? Cool.
		</p>

		<h1 id="1-you-need-to-know-the-basics-of-a-language-to-write-in-it">
			1. You need to know the basics of a language to write in it
		</h1>

		<p>
			I tried to write the site compiler in C# originally. The issue with that
			is that I don’t know C#. So there’s a nice little pro tip.
		</p>

		<h1 id="2-divs-are-really-neat">
			2. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code>s
			are really neat.
		</h1>

		<p>
			I think I began to use them a lot more, especially with the progress bars
			and all the sort. They’re very helpful, especially with the mess that is
			“me writing CSS” and also inheritance, or something like that.
		</p>

		<p>
			I’m done with the list, I’m just going to write down some of my other
			thoughts.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really… didn’t know what I was doing half this time. I wrote some stuff,
			I looked at reference, and the entire process (and result, but more on
			that later,) was a giant disorganized mess.
		</p>

		<p>
			I suppose I should thank some sites, but more specifically: the people who
			contribute to the
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a> and
			<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - for wannabe
			developers like myself, your contributions make for great reference
			material. Thanks!
		</p>

		<p>
			But more on the result - it’s a mess. I dread looking at the “code” again
			- it’s an amalgamation of multi-line HTML strings, many repeated things
			that could probably be simplified, stored in variables, or consolidated
			into functions - but I didn’t do that. Which may have been why this took
			so long. Maybe when I finish writing this, and go to compile it, there’s
			going to be another issue somewhere, and it’s going to take me another few
			hours to solve it. That’ll be… great.
		</p>

		<p>
			I did feel like I learned quite an amount from this, though. I’ll probably
			have to look back through some fundamentals, but I’ll probably go off to
			write something bigger after this. I might build a better Discord bot this
			time! Those are always fun to write.
		</p>

		<p>
			And just to test some more elements of the compiler/markdownjs, here’s a
			list of things I should learn:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>How to debug code (especially node.js)</li>
			<li>Writing unit tests (and tests in general)</li>
			<li>Actually organizing and planning code</li>
		</ul>

		<p>That’s all.</p>

		<p>I’m done here.</p>

		<p>
			If you’re reading this, I’m amazed. Thanks. I hope you got a chuckle out
			of this.
		</p>

		<p>See ya next time?</p>

		<p>
			(Oh, and follow me on
			<a href="https;//twitter.com/AndzCLiv3">Twitter</a> and look at other of
			my crimes against humanity on my
			<a href="https://github.com/andythepie">GitHub</a> profile.)
