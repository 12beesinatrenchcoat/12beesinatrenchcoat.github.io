        <div class="body"><p>Welcome to the fourth iteration of my website, website v4! There's a bunch of new things here, a <code>/projects/</code> section, a <code>/blog/</code> section, with posts now written in Markdown, and compiled using <code>gray-matter</code> and <code>showdown</code>. I'm surprised it's actually working.</p>
<p>You can probably find the project page, where I'll go more in detail about the behind the scenes of it all <a href="https://andythepie.github.io/projects/02.20.2020-website_v4.html">around here somewhere</a>. Here, I'll talk about why I rewrote my site, and some things I learned. Please note that I am a relatively new "developer" with an extraordinary lack of experience. Cool? Cool.</p>
<h1 id="1youneedtoknowthebasicsofalanguagetowriteinit">1. You need to know the basics of a language to write in it</h1>
<p>I tried to write the site compiler in C# originally. The issue with that is that I don't know C#. So there's a nice little pro tip.</p>
<h1 id="2divsarereallyneat">2. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s are really neat.</h1>
<p>I think I began to use them a lot more, especially with the progress bars and all the sort. They're very helpful, especially with the mess that is "me writing CSS" and also inheritance, or something like that.</p>
<p>I'm done with the list, I'm just going to write down some of my other thoughts.</p>
<p>I really… didn't know what I was doing half this time. I wrote some stuff, I looked at reference, and the entire process (and result, but more on that later,) was a giant disorganized mess.</p>
<p>I suppose I should thank some sites, but more specifically: the people who contribute to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - for wannabe developers like myself, your contributions make for great reference material. Thanks!</p>
<p>But more on the result - it's a mess. I dread looking at the "code" again - it's an amalgamation of multi-line HTML strings, many repeated things that could probably be simplified, stored in variables, or consolidated into functions - but I didn't do that. Which may have been why this took so long. Maybe when I finish writing this, and go to compile it, there's going to be another issue somewhere, and it's going to take me another few hours to solve it. That'll be… great.</p>
<p>I did feel like I learned quite an amount from this, though. I'll probably have to look back through some fundamentals, but I'll probably go off to write something bigger after this. I might build a better Discord bot this time! Those are always fun to write. </p>
<p>And just to test some more elements of the compiler/markdownjs, here's a list of things I should learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to debug code (especially node.js)</li>
<li>Writing unit tests (and tests in general)</li>
<li>Actually organizing and planning code</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>I'm done here. </p>
<p>If you're reading this, I'm amazed. Thanks. I hope you got a chuckle out of this.</p>
<p>See ya next time?</p>
