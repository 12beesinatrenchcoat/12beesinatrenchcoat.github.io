# AndyThePie.github.io
A questionably thrown together website for my own experimentation/blog. It looks... meh.
Still currently *very* work in progress.

## Can I contribute?
If you find anything *very* wrong, or you just have any suggestions, please open up an issue.

## Can I copy this for my own website?
You probably shouldn't, but I don't mind.

## Licenses
*Most* code is my own, there are comments around code that isn't mine or a derivative of some other code. Brand icons belong to said brand. Yadda yadda yadda.

## Special Thanks
