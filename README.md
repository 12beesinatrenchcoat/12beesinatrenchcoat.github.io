# AndyThePie.github.io

a [fourth] attempt at creating a website. yes, we're on the fourth iteration now. wow.

this website contains information about me, (primarily my social networks), my projects, and some blog posts. 

## can i contribute?

i mean... i don't know why you would, but if you want to yell at me about how my code is bad, then do so. i'm not gonna stop you. posts and words are my own though.

## licensing

the content of this website (images, text, and any markdown files that aren't this one) are under the **[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**, and my code is under **[The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)**. why? eh.

## dependencies
i do use MarkDig as a markdown -> html compiler, and that is under the **BSD-2 Clause**.
i also use YamlDotNet, which is under the **MIT License**.

i guess also don't pretend to be me. thanks.
