my hand slipped.</p>

<p>In the project page for <a href="/projects/2020-02-20-website_v4.html">website v4</a>, I jokingly said something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until the inevitable re:re:rewrite,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And offline, I’d throw around jokes about how I’d end up hating my website so much that I would never update it - that the rewrite of the website was inevitable. Well, guess what?</p>

<p>Past me was correct.<img src="/assets/images/old_website-v4.webp" alt="old_website-v4" /></p>

<p>The old website was… not great. At least, by my [current] standards (which, admittedly, are still very, <em>very</em> low). The code used to make it was a mess - if I were to change the site’s look in a few years time, I’d have to rewrite the thing, sorting through lines and lines of unformatted HTML in an already confusing, spaghetti JavaScript file. Oh, and it doesn’t look… great.</p>

<p>However, you learn these things with retrospect - when you do something, you learn from it. You figure out what worked, what didn’t, even if you can’t put it into words (please <em>don’t</em> see the <a href="/blog/2020/07/26/pencil_to_pluto_postmortem.html">Pencil to Pluto Postmortem</a>). I learned from website v4 that <del>am an awful programmer</del> I overestimated my knowledge of JavaScript, and also that I <em>really</em> should have just used a static site generator such as Jekyll instead of trying to create my own, featureless version of it.</p>

<p>So I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to rewrite my website, with a new framework, a new design, all of that. Make it so that I’d actually want to come back and write something every now and then. I think I accomplished that. I hope.</p>

<h2 id="alright-alright-so-whats-new">Alright, alright, so what’s new?</h2>

<p>Well, I added some things, I removed some things, but fundamentally, the site works the same way it used to. Takes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files in folders, turns them into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> files, adds some nice styles, headers, etc. One thing of note that I’ve removed: progress bars. I don’t like them, nor do I like constantly updating people on my work - I just like doing this stuff without worrying.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/website v4 vs v5.webp" alt="website v4 vs v5" /></p>

<p>I’ve switched to using Jekyll - no more of that clunky handwritten site generator. It’s honestly quite nice, I can just simply <del>struggle with</del> write some HTML, plug in some fields, and I have a properly functioning site. That being said, this did take a bit longer than website v4, taking a bit under two weeks instead of three days. This website is still hosted via GitHub Pages, and still with a clunky build script running after each push (see <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/">Jekyll Docs</a> on building with GitHub Actions).</p>

<p>Oh, and the patterns for each project. I really like them. They were a horrific mess to set up, but they’re simple enough - a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background-image</code> set to the project’s respective header image, followed by an absolutely positioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::before</code> pseudo-element layering some patterns I stole from the <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/">CSS3 Patterns Gallery</a>, and a slight dim, created by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linear-gradient</code> that goes from a translucent black to… the same translucent black. (Status is also displayed with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">::after</code> pseudo-element, in the bottom-right.)</p>

<p>Even while writing this, I’m still changing some minor things in the site, adding a little translucent white background to each post on the blog listing, and before I publish all of this, I plan on converting as many images as I can to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.webp</code> format, hopefully lowering the likely massive load and size of this site - sorry about that!</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ll stop now. You’re looking at website v5 - and I hope it doesn’t look… awful.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading, something something something.</p>

(Not that the source code for everything I’ve ever made is public and can be found at that exact repository, but… you know what I mean.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Slabbot</em> was originally going to be a fork and overhaul of <em><a href="https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon">despacitoBot;</a></em> with more features and cool stuff, but I didn’t feel like looking at my old code, so I decided to just rewrite it from scratch.
    <ul>
      <li>Like <em>despacitoBot</em>, <em>Slabbot</em> is also written in JavaScript, utilizing Node.js and Discord.js. However, this time, I employed the help of the <a href="https://discord-akairo.github.io">Akairo Framework</a>! Not that I’m really putting it to any good use, but…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Slabbot</em> is a portmanteau of the words “slab” and “bot” - like a slab, the bot is large, thick, flat, and typically made of stone- wait, no, hold on-
    <ul>
      <li><em>Slabbot</em> is pronounced like “rabbit”, so… <em>“slæbət”</em>? Don’t ask.</li>

Even though this is <em>literally the first finished iteration of it</em>. Ignore the previous iterations from the past two years (and the fact that I lost an iteration due to a hard drive formatting).</p>

<p><strong>Update [26 July 2020]:</strong> The status of this has been marked “work in progress” for the longest time. it’s not. It’s been done for a while now. Even though the compiler is disgusting to look at and I really need to rewrite it.</p>

<p>So, into the technical stuff. What does this do, how does it work, and any other things.</p>

<p><em>Just a fair warning: I am not very qualified to write about this stuff. And also this is very substanceless. Cool.</em></p>

<h1 id="the-goal-of-it-all">The Goal Of It All</h1>

<p>I wrote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">website v4</code> with one main goal: to be able to write my posts and projects in Markdown (with YAML front matter serving as metadata). This was an ambitious goal, mainly because of the fact that I have nearly zero experience with JavaScript (what the “compiler” was written in) - or any other programming language, for that matter. The fact that this is still working is amazing.</p>

<h1 id="how-it-all-works">How It All Works</h1>

<p>The compiler is written in JavaScript with Node.js, and utilizes two main libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter">gray-matter</a> - used for parsing the YAML into some usable information</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown">showdown</a> - actually turning the markdown into an html site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, how does it all work? (Or at least, how is it supposed to?)</p>

<p>First, the script (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.js</code>) is executed. It proceeds to read the contents of two preset directories, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog/md</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/projects/md</code>, where the markdown files are stored. After that, for each file in the directory, it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reads the file, and saves the content into a variable.</li>
  <li>Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gray-matter</code> to parse the file, and save the result of that into a variable.</li>
  <li>Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showdown</code> to convert the markdown into HTML</li>
  <li>Appends some extra HTML to the result. This is where the YAML comes in handy - it plugs in variables in certain spots, such as the title, the date, progress (if the file is a project), etc.</li>
  <li>Saves the file to the parent directory (of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/md</code> directory).</li>
  <li>Somewhere along the line, it would update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> with a little entry so people can actually access it.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s how it should work. It’s actually a lot messier than that. (Don’t read the source code, it’s a nightmare.)</p>

<p>And that’s all! I hope. I’m not coming back to this. Ever.</p>

<p>Until the inevitable re:re:rewrite,</p>
