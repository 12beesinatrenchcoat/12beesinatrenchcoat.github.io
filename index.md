<h1 class="emphasis-highlight">hello there! o/</h1>

My name is Andy Chan, a self-described "wannabe stuff maker".

In other words, I make things - anything creative I find intesting, from code, to art, to music, to videos, and a lot more - not that I'm necessarily good at any of it. Jack of all trades, master of none. That's me!

I have a [blog](/blog.html) where I sometimes ramble. Sometimes I like listing [projects](/projects.html) I've worked on.

I think that's all. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/12bz_trenchcoat){:class="ext twitter"} if you so please, or look at whatever nonsense I've posted on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/andychanpineapples){:class="ext youtube"}.
