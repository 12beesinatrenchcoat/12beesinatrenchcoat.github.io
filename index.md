<h1 class="emphasis-highlight">hello there! o/</h1>

My name is Andy Chan, a "wannabe stuff maker".

In other words, I make things - anything creative I find intesting, from code, to art, to music, to videos, and a lot more - not that I'm necessarily good at any of it. Jack of all trades, master of none. That's me!

I have a [blog](/blog.html) where I sometimes ramble. Sometimes I list [projects](/projects.html) I've worked (or am working) on.

I think that's all. I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/12bz_trenchcoat), sometimes I post things to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/andychanpineapples), and I serve fresh spaghetti on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AndyThePie) from time to time.

## some other stuff about the site
This site is powered using the excellent [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted with GitHub Pages. Its icons come from a subsetted version of [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com). You can find the source code of the site [here](https://github.com/andythepie/andythepie.github.io) (at your own risk, code quality is… ehhh).

There's also an [Atom feed](/feed.xml), for those who still use that (<3!)
