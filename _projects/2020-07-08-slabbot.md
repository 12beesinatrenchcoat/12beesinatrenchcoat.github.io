I don't have much to say about it - all I can say is that it is a Discord bot. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/AndyThePie/slabbot), I suppose. You can't invite the bot to a server yet because I still don't have any method to host it. Yet.

## Random Facts!

- *Slabbot* was originally going to be a fork and overhaul of *[despacitoBot;](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon)* with more features and cool stuff, but I didn't feel like looking at my old code, so I decided to just rewrite it from scratch.
  - Like *despacitoBot*, *Slabbot* is also written in JavaScript, utilizing Node.js and Discord.js. However, this time, I employed the help of the [Akairo Framework](https://discord-akairo.github.io)! Not that I'm really putting it to any good use, but...
- *Slabbot* is a portmanteau of the words "slab" and "bot" - like a slab, the bot is large, thick, flat, and typically made of stone- wait, no, hold on-
  - *Slabbot* is pronounced like "rabbit", so... *"slæbət"*? Don't ask.
- I still don't understand ES6.
