In the span of three days, I wrote and actually finished the fourth iteration of my website, aptly titled... `website v4`. Even though this is *literally the first finished iteration of it*. Ignore the previous iterations from the past two years (and the fact that I lost an iteration due to a hard drive formatting).

**Update [26 July 2020]:** The status of this has been marked "work in progress" for the longest time. it's not. It's been done for a while now. Even though the compiler is disgusting to look at and I really need to rewrite it.

So, into the technical stuff. What does this do, how does it work, and any other things.

*Just a fair warning: I am not very qualified to write about this stuff. And also this is very substanceless. Cool.*

# The Goal Of It All

I wrote `website v4` with one main goal: to be able to write my posts and projects in Markdown (with YAML front matter serving as metadata). This was an ambitious goal, mainly because of the fact that I have nearly zero experience with JavaScript (what the "compiler" was written in) - or any other programming language, for that matter. The fact that this is still working is amazing.

# How It All Works

The compiler is written in JavaScript with Node.js, and utilizes two main libraries:

- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) [(repo)](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) - used for parsing the YAML into some usable information
- [showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) [(repo)](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) - actually turning the markdown into an html site.

Now, how does it all work? (Or at least, how is it supposed to?)

First, the script (`main.js`) is executed. It proceeds to read the contents of two preset directories, `/blog/md`, and `/projects/md`, where the markdown files are stored. After that, for each file in the directory, it:

1. Reads the file, and saves the content into a variable.
2. Uses `gray-matter` to parse the file, and save the result of that into a variable.
3. Uses `showdown` to convert the markdown into HTML
4. Appends some extra HTML to the result. This is where the YAML comes in handy - it plugs in variables in certain spots, such as the title, the date, progress (if the file is a project), etc.
5. Saves the file to the parent directory (of the `/md` directory). 
6. Somewhere along the line, it would update `index.html` with a little entry so people can actually access it.

And that's how it should work. It's actually a lot messier than that. (Don't read the source code, it's a nightmare.)



And that's all! I hope. I'm not coming back to this. Ever.



Until the inevitable re:re:rewrite,
