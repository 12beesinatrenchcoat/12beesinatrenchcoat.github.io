# this is a readme

The YAML front matter for the files here should be something like:

```yaml
title: # the title
description: # description
tags:	
  # a list of tags.
startDate: # the date the project started, in format YYYY-MM-DD
endDate: # used only for projects where status is "complete" or "scrapped"
status: # status can be: "complete", "wip", "on_hold", or "scrapped"
headerImage: # header image. please refer to image relative to site root.
```

Just leaving this here in case I end up forgetting about all of this.
