## The Goal:
Get gathering people to host Among Us lobby easier, aswell has broadcasting the lobby code.

## The Outcome:
I rewrote the original Krinio bot to use "Doob Core", which is based off of [Doob's](https://github.com/doobdev/doob){:class="ext github"} base code. It worked very well, and I even publicized the bot!

## Why Stop?
[GitHub Issue #31](https://github.com/DoobDev/Krinio/issues/31){:class="ext github"}, this bug made it so that if I restarted Doob (or Krinio) on the same VPS, the other bot would go down.

As Doob is my main focus, I have decided (for now) to stop working on Krinio.
