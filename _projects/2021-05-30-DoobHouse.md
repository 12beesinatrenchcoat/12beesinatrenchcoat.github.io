## The Goal:
Port [Doob](https://doobbot.com){:class="ext other"} commands to [DogeHouse](https://dogehouse.tv){:class="ext other"} using [Dogehouse.py](https://github.com/dogegarden/dogehouse.py){:class="ext github"}

## The Outcome:
Worked pretty well! Didn't work on it that much, as I stopped coding features on March 30, 2021. I successfully ported dogfact, dogpic, the now deprecated dogehouse command, owoify, and valroll.

## Why stop?
1. The Dogehouse.py library had stopped getting worked on
2. DogeHouse itself was declining in rooms/visiters (imo)
3. DogeHouse has officially shut down.
