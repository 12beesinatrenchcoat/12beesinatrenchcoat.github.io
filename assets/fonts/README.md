# Fonts, fonts, fonts! 

My website uses three different fonts:
- Open Sans ([Google Fonts link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)), developed by Steve Matteson is the primary font used on this site. Weights used include Regular 400 and Semi-Bold 600. The fonts are being served using [Brick](https://brick.im/).
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) is the code font used on my site. Its regular variant is included in this folder. The font is under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/blob/master/OFL.txt).
- [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) is used for the icons. The highly subset version in this folder was created using Fontello. The font is under the SIL Open Font License 1.1  (See the [Font Awesome Free License](https://fontawesome.com/license/free) page).
