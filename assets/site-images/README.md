# site-images
> wait, why would you create this folder?

a bit of a distinction -- `/assets/images` includes images used in posts and as banners, while this folder, `/assets/site-images`, includes images that are used as part of the siteâ€¦ or something like that. 

Notably, a `logo.svg`, which is displayed on the right side of the navbar. That's kind of important.
